# Native Application that controls UAV and UGV.
# Development Steps
Basic steps to get the project working. I’ve never installed node on windows before but it doesn’t look too hard:
 - Download and install Node.js for windows: https://nodejs.org/en/#download
 - You’ll want to install “electron” and “ar-drone” globally (-g) via npm with the following command: npm install <package_name> -g
 - Download the project directory from the download link on my wpui: http://ec2-52-2-54-149.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/wpui/wpui
 - Use the electron guide for instructions on starting the app: https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/#run-your-app
